# What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there an event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

I can remember having an interest in IT since I could turn on the family computer, it became a passion when one of the locals of my parent’s small country pub, had seen my keen interest in what he was doing. Over those formative years of my life, I was taught a lot of computer fundamentals. This experience led me to my current path as a communications sailor in the Royal Australian Navy. This role further increased my experience in the field through giving me the opportunity to continue to broaden my skillset, from learning level 1 tech support and managing an Active Directory to the configuration of satellite communications equipment.

# Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

Due to the nature of my work, I needed to attend a university that was going to allow to conduct university studies from the remote locations my job would put me in, RMIT through Open Universities Australia (OUA) was the only university offering the Bachelor IT undergrad that would understand the unique position that I was in, and provide the support that I would need. So far, my experiences with distance education has been overwhelmingly supportive, there was a point of instability where I was doing high-tempo operation in the middle east region where my lecturers were more then helpful in providing me the time required to complete assessments to a satisfactory standard.

# What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I’ve always felt confident in the application of ICT, but I believe that this degree will give me a more structured learning environment, where I will learn a more professional application of the skills that I will pick up throughout the forthcoming units, I believe that I will be able to correct any bad habits that I have picked up from a lot of my self-education, and hopefully become better at managing my projects and attaining a deeper understanding on the course content.
