### What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there an event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

I can remember having an interest in IT since I could turn on the family computer, it became a passion when one of the locals of my parent’s small country pub, had seen my keen interest in what he was doing. Over those formative years of my life, I was taught a lot of computer fundamentals. This experience led me to my current path as a communications sailor in the Royal Australian Navy. This role further increased my experience in the field through giving me the opportunity to continue to broaden my skillset, from learning level 1 tech support and managing an Active Directory to the configuration of satellite communications equipment.

### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

Due to the nature of my work, I needed to attend a university that was going to allow to conduct university studies from the remote locations my job would put me in, RMIT through Open Universities Australia (OUA) was the only university offering the Bachelor IT undergrad that would understand the unique position that I was in, and provide the support that I would need. So far, my experiences with distance education has been overwhelmingly supportive, there was a point of instability where I was doing high-tempo operation in the middle east region where my lecturers were more then helpful in providing me the time required to complete assessments to a satisfactory standard.

### What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I’ve always felt confident in the application of ICT, but I believe that this degree will give me a more structured learning environment, where I will learn a more professional application of the skills that I will pick up throughout the forthcoming units, I believe that I will be able to correct any bad habits that I have picked up from a lot of my self-education, and hopefully become better at managing my projects and attaining a deeper understanding on the course content.

### Description

This role is would place me as a Senior IT Systems Administrator for a national company. This role would have the successful applicant design and configure cloud computing solutions, networks, servers, and business applications. You would be required to respond to unplanned outages and other ICT problems. Additional to these duties you would be responsible for providing IT support for team members and be a point of escalation of junior members. There may be a requirement for project management where you will be required to provide scripts and programming.

### Requirements for role
•	Relevant Tertiary qualifications (TAFE/University) or be able to demonstrate the required skills (effectively Recognised Prior Learning RPL)
•	Time management skills that would allow you to manage a workload of multiple project in an efficient manner that will meet established deadlines.
•	Experience in administration of Office 365, Azure, & InTune
•	Experience with management of network hardware from common vendors like CISCO, Palo Alto etc.
•	Experience with Cloud providers AWS & Azure.
•	Interpersonal & communications Skills
•	Effective troubleshooting skill.
•	Can work unsupervised, and independently, and within a team.
•	Working with Children’s Check.

## Skills, qualifications & experience I currently have for the role
I do not (currently) have the tertiary education, and I do not believe that I would be able to demonstrate the required skills if I was interviewing for this role tomorrow, I am not worried about the time management skills, as in my current role I have had to oversee the installation of equipment with strict deadlines, whilst dealing with secondary and even tertiary roles required of me during a high-tempo operational deployment, I have no experience with administration of Office 365 or Azure, and I don’t even know what Intune was until today, This is because my administration skillset is to do with servers located on site, where we control the BareMetal server and the VM’s attached to it. I have however done a couple of Microsoft courses through work that gave me additional experience with Azure, however nil experience with AWS, I have experience with the configuration of CISCO routers but no formal education. my verbal interpersonal and communications would be enough for this role, however I have some deficiencies with my written communications skills, I can work unsupervised and independently as well as in a team, which is shown in my yearly performance reviews. I do not have the working with children’s check, but I do not believe I would have any issues with getting it. 

## Obtaining the missing skillset
First task would be obtaining my tertiary degree, this combined with my current experience and future experience whilst studying would make me more competitive for the role, secondly, I would start looking for accredited courses in Microsoft, CISCO, Palo Alto, and Amazon AWS additionally during this time obtain the working with children check. I would also see what courses are available through my work, as they often will place members on ICT related courses to boost the capability of it’s workforce, and I would volunteer myself on as many ICT projects that I could get my hands on because they’re mostly run by third-party vendors who already have this knowledge and are generally willing to assist.

[Vote Compass](https://i.imgur.com/QgFmuTM.png)

## What Do the results of these test mean for you?
Honestly, not a great deal, these are free tests and are done in an uncontrolled environment, I’ve done the same Myers-Briggs test prior and have gotten totally different results. The reasoning behind picking the Vote COMPASS test is because I would work better with people that I have common interests in.

## How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
Neither negatively or positively, the only influencing factor within a team for me is ensuring that I’m working with members who want to complete the task effectively and efficiently.

## How should you take this into account when forming a team?
I wouldn’t, these tests don’t consider the effort of some team members, if they’re going to apply themselves and if they’re just their to do the bare-minimum of a pass or if they’re striving to achieve better than average. 

### Project 
## Video Game Aggregation Platform (VGAP)

## Overview
This project will be about the development of a piece of software that would allow for the management of a user’s PC games onto one easily managed program. Here they will be able to combine the libraries of their PC games from platforms such as STEAM, uPlay, and ORIGIN onto one easy to use application. Here the user will be able to manage their games using tags and categories that will allow them to organise their games in however they see fit. Additionally, they will be able to update and launch their games from this single platform instead of from different platforms. 

## Motivation
In the past most developers and publishers would use the STEAM platform to launch their own video games, however many publishers were upset with how steam would take upwards of 30% of the sales from games. Electronic Arts (EA) was one of the first companies to stop selling its games on the STEAM and started their own platform ORIGIN. Here they begun selling their large catalogue of video games to the public. This has made many people upset as it forced them to split their digital library over two platforms instead of having it conveniently located in one location. The motivation for this program would be to unify the two libraries into one convenient location.

## Description
This application would integrate all your entire games library through multiple platforms to be integrated into one easy to use location. Users would also be able to add the executable of games that do not have DRM attached to them (e.g. bought from GOG, and shareware) The overall design of the application would be minimalistic to match windows 10. Games would be detected through searching for their executable in common folders. It would feature a light and dark theme to allow further customisation for the user, as well as an ability for the user to set predefined boxes within the application to allow the user to customise to a theme they desire. Features of this application would allow you to set categories of your games, allowing you to order your games in a way the user would find suitable, additionally it would allow users to track all of there hours into one location, using steam’s API, it would allow you to import your hours from the steam platform into the application, showing how much time you have played on your games. The time tracked would also give you a weekly break down to allow you to manage how much time you have spent playing games, where over the seven-day period it would show the total as well as divide how many hours a day you have been playing. To make navigation easy of the application easy, the user would be able to choose how they would want their games shown, users will be able to display the library as a list on the left hand sidebar where only the games name would be shown alongside a icon that would be displayed if the user had a shortcut on the desktop. When A single clicked a game, the game would highlight on the side bar, and information would be displayed about it such as time played, the alternate view would be the main window displaying the users library in a grid where the games would be displayed in rectangles by around 200w x 150h pixels where artwork of the game with the games name superimposed, this would scale with the resolution of the users monitor allowing for more games to be displayed per row, additionally user would also be able to upload custom images to display within the rectangles, this would be helpful in situations with games that don’t have banners automatically add through the API. This software would be free for all users, with no intention of it being monetised through advertisement. 

## Tools & Technology
This application is focused for gamers, so it would be assumed that they would have a gaming PC as it is the only hardware requirement for this software. Users would require access to the internet and the digital distribution platform STEAM to make use of the API integration. The final requirement for this software would be owning PC games, and having them installed on the computer, for this application to work correct they would require a .exe to build the shortcut from. 

## Skills Required
No specialised hardware would be required for this task, as stated previously the only hardware requirement is a gaming PC. Programming is the primary skill required for this task, with my current skills in programming it would be a slow progress in getting this application created, but with the help of open-source projects such as GitHub finding the relevant knowledge and skill makes this project feasible.

## Outcome
If this project would be successful, users would have an effective way to manage their library of games on their PC, they would not to open multiple applications on their computer to launch their titles. It’s overall a simple solution for an issue for some gamers where they want to consolidate all their games into one location, it may reduce the stress of wanting to purchase a game, but not due to not wanting to split your library over two digital distribution platforms.
