### What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there an event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

I can remember having an interest in IT since I could turn on the family computer, it became a passion when one of the locals of my parent’s small country pub, had seen my keen interest in what he was doing. Over those formative years of my life, I was taught a lot of computer fundamentals. This experience led me to my current path as a communications sailor in the Royal Australian Navy. This role further increased my experience in the field through giving me the opportunity to continue to broaden my skillset, from learning level 1 tech support and managing an Active Directory to the configuration of satellite communications equipment.

### Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

Due to the nature of my work, I needed to attend a university that was going to allow to conduct university studies from the remote locations my job would put me in, RMIT through Open Universities Australia (OUA) was the only university offering the Bachelor IT undergrad that would understand the unique position that I was in, and provide the support that I would need. So far, my experiences with distance education has been overwhelmingly supportive, there was a point of instability where I was doing high-tempo operation in the middle east region where my lecturers were more then helpful in providing me the time required to complete assessments to a satisfactory standard.

### What do you expect to learn during your studies?

I’ve always felt confident in the application of ICT, but I believe that this degree will give me a more structured learning environment, where I will learn a more professional application of the skills that I will pick up throughout the forthcoming units, I believe that I will be able to correct any bad habits that I have picked up from a lot of my self-education, and hopefully become better at managing my projects and attaining a deeper understanding on the course content.

### Description

This role is would place me as a Senior IT Systems Administrator for a national company. This role would have the successful applicant design and configure cloud computing solutions, networks, servers, and business applications. You would be required to respond to unplanned outages and other ICT problems. Additional to these duties you would be responsible for providing IT support for team members and be a point of escalation of junior members. There may be a requirement for project management where you will be required to provide scripts and programming.

### Requirements for role
•	Relevant Tertiary qualifications (TAFE/University) or be able to demonstrate the required skills (effectively Recognised Prior Learning RPL)
•	Time management skills that would allow you to manage a workload of multiple project in an efficient manner that will meet established deadlines.
•	Experience in administration of Office 365, Azure, & InTune
•	Experience with management of network hardware from common vendors like CISCO, Palo Alto etc.
•	Experience with Cloud providers AWS & Azure.
•	Interpersonal & communications Skills
•	Effective troubleshooting skill.
•	Can work unsupervised, and independently, and within a team.
•	Working with Children’s Check.

## Skills, qualifications & experience I currently have for the role
I do not (currently) have the tertiary education, and I do not believe that I would be able to demonstrate the required skills if I was interviewing for this role tomorrow, I am not worried about the time management skills, as in my current role I have had to oversee the installation of equipment with strict deadlines, whilst dealing with secondary and even tertiary roles required of me during a high-tempo operational deployment, I have no experience with administration of Office 365 or Azure, and I don’t even know what Intune was until today, This is because my administration skillset is to do with servers located on site, where we control the BareMetal server and the VM’s attached to it. I have however done a couple of Microsoft courses through work that gave me additional experience with Azure, however nil experience with AWS, I have experience with the configuration of CISCO routers but no formal education. my verbal interpersonal and communications would be enough for this role, however I have some deficiencies with my written communications skills, I can work unsupervised and independently as well as in a team, which is shown in my yearly performance reviews. I do not have the working with children’s check, but I do not believe I would have any issues with getting it. 

## Obtaining the missing skillset
First task would be obtaining my tertiary degree, this combined with my current experience and future experience whilst studying would make me more competitive for the role, secondly, I would start looking for accredited courses in Microsoft, CISCO, Palo Alto, and Amazon AWS additionally during this time obtain the working with children check. I would also see what courses are available through my work, as they often will place members on ICT related courses to boost the capability of it’s workforce, and I would volunteer myself on as many ICT projects that I could get my hands on because they’re mostly run by third-party vendors who already have this knowledge and are generally willing to assist.
